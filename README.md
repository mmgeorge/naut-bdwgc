# Overview

This project aims to bring the [Boehm-Demers-Weiser](https://www.hboehm.info/gc/) conservative garbage collector to nautilus.

# What is the Nautilus AeroKernel?

Nautilus is an example of an AeroKernel, a very thin kernel-layer exposed 
(much like a library OS, or libOS) directly to the runtime and application. 
AeroKernels are suited particularly well for parallel runtimes that need fine-grained,
explicit control of the machine to squeeze every bit of performance out of it.
